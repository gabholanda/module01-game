# Welcome to Heroes Ironbattle ! TL-DR:
  This was a game made using Javascript with HTML Canvas utilizing requestAnimationFrame API to animate the Spritesheets. The
spritesheet's maker and background music contacts will be at the bottom of this README. This game follows a Action RPG genre with a never-ending five on one battle for every wave on the same map without rest. It was a solo project programming wise with the objective to satisfy my inner child for making a game, it took more than 40 working hours to complete it and make it playable.

# Game Controls:
Press the arrow keys to move and Enter to pause game
 Press the Z and X keys do attack ( X normally drains mana and Summoner only has Z attack )

# Attributes:
 HP: Health Points
 Mana: Resource to cast skills
 STR: Strength
 AGI: Agility
#INT: Intelligence

# Game Logic:
 The heroes fights forever and upon defeating a wave another one comes immediately.
 For every wave defeated the heroes and the monsters levelUp and powerUp.
 If a hero HP drops to 0 and bellow it's Game Over.
 Refresh page to restart game.
